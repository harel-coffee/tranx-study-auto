Overall it's pretty interesting, but maybe too time consuming.",4,"Having an integrated method to suggest code snippets is very handy, especially for API usages. Compared with manual search, this is faster and less disruptive.","When I use the plugin, it's often because I need to know how to use an API. The generated code examples were usually of lower quality in this case, and the retrieved answers contained too much irrelevant code (such as setting up the environment, and/or interactive console outputs). These irrelevant code could be useful for understanding the snippet, but it's quite a burden to delete them every time.",,Yes
7/4/2020 18:05:50,2ceafaf6a21d6cb6495038b38ab72061,"not very hard, I am at least familiar with part of the task and am able to ask trans-X or the internet",3,"I kinda like the stack overflow part of the retrieved code, sometimes I just cannot remember the exact code, but I remember the shape. I could select the correct one easily. Save my time compared to search in  a web browser. Note -- I am using ALFRED for search shortcut, I don't need to open the browser, enter question, and search. Just command + space + question will direct me to the resulted google page. But I still think retrieving the code directly is more convenient compared to ALFRED + click a page.","I am trying to incorporate variable names or strings when ask a question, however, most of the time, this variable name or string is not included in the tranX generated result. On the other hand, it is not very natural for me to ""instantiate"" my questions, I mostly like to search keywords or just a description of what I want to achieve. ","If I do suggested code (nested) twice and ALT+G,  part of the code will disappear. ",Yes
7/22/2020 23:45:19,67e86a0cb1f9b6cae0e8d6c4b24711de,"It is a bit difficult to write everything from scratch, especially for data processing task",4,"For those easy tasks, like walk through the directory in filesystem, this plugin save my time because what i did previously is to go to stackoverflow can copy the code. But for difficult task like data processing or ML, the plugin is not helpful. Most snippet are not useful and i have to go to webste like sklearn to read the full doc to understand what i should do",I hope the codesnipt generated can have more comments or usage. Otherwise I still need to search web to understand what it is,no,Yes
7/23/2020 21:34:31,34b1ef17e6625ba2350f6f1c169591a1,"more related to data analysis, requires fairly amount of search. Some of them are very tricky. need to be quite familiar with pandas, matplotlib, numpy, etc.",4,"some small things can be searched extremely conveniently. like one small syntax or api i forget about pandas or matplotlib. I don't have to search online with a keyword ""python"", and do a bunch of copying/pasting. the results are filtered and listed clearly for me to choose.","The SOTA model needs some improvements. I feel that I choose more from stackoverflow rather than the model (But the model did help sometimes and I found what I looked for). One suggestion is that, the model tends to take the searching keys words as names. For example, when I type plot titles, what I wanted was ""plt.title(...)"" or ""ax.suptitle(...)"" but what the model gives me was ""plot.plot(title, title)"" or something similar. maybe I need search ""title of plot"" to avoid confusion? Another suggestion is that, when the plu- in auto-copies contents from stackoverflow for me,  a bunch of outputs are also copied, so I had to do lots of deletion. Also, some code lines started with "">>"" which can be removed if possible.","good job! love this. Need to mention that, the sample output of one question, titled ""price_by_horsepower.csv"" is an incorrect output. There should only be 3 columns as stated in README. ",Yes
7/28/2020 15:05:34,844088c7077d499fa3533250ae504e7f,"They seemed to be very small tasks, so I felt I already knew how to do most/all of the task, making the plugin not that useful. The difficult parts of the task, for example, in the Wikipedia scraping, was figuring out the exact layout of the page, which is something that the plugin was not helpful for (and presumably, not designed for).",3,"It was somewhat convenient to not have to switch tabs to Google things, but otherwise I don't feel I got a lot of benefit out of using the plugin vs. Googling, and it seems, based on my memory, that most of the suggestions I got were from the internet anyway.","It would be nice if the examples from the internet could contain the relevant context of the discussion (e.g., things to consider when using this suggestion), as well as the input/output examples, as it currently does. However, when copying the code into my program, I would like to **not** copy the input/output examples, and I can't imagine ever wanting those in the program itself.","This is not so much a comment for the plugin as the study itself. I wasn't sure how I was supposed to know when to use the plugin and when not to, so for the first couple of tasks, I ended up manually enabling it (I assumed it was some bug that it didn't show up), figuring that I would have to, as that's what I was supposed to do for the warmup. I assume that will invalidate my results on the first couple tasks, so I apologize. However, I would suggest making it clearer when to use and when not to use the plugin.",Yes
7/30/2020 9:11:22,2e3e8fa9d9f7b9fed260130d754b6308,some task are easy and some other are very difficult,4,"-It decreases the time spent to search for different tasks on the web and other resources.
-it has all resources needed at one place.
-it is efficient.",There should some improvement on code edits.sometimes it show cursor position not inside generated code block while the cursor is inside the generated code block. state-of-the-art natural language to code generation model sometimes shows code that is completely unrelated to what is searched. ,,Yes
7/31/2020 11:21:26,cbfad61871126c1cc4c85d8bdb7fdddf,It was a good tasks with different level of difficulty. I like the plugin's features.,4,It was very cool to look at some examples without leaving IDE. And in some cases I used the proposed code in my code.,It was rare when i can use a code from plugin in a straight way but it's still cool to watch some examples.,I didn't get for a first time that i should press Alt+G every time when i fix the proposed code.,Yes
8/1/2020 14:51:43,9dd43727b9246d7f2220b94ff43380cf,It was mixture of tasks some were a bit tough some were really basic. I enjoyed it in overall sense.,5,I figured out which function to use for a particular scenario much easily than before.,I normally use web browsers. So I am not sure how to compare these two things.,Sometimes I felt that it would be better if I could see the arguments of each function from the plugin because I needed to use browser to check for the function arguments after getting the function suggestion from the plugin,Yes
8/2/2020 14:19:49,4d52cf690a039273baca11d5bf55f0a7,I think the tasks weren't too difficult and were a nice review for me. All of them were enjoyable except the user posts comments query one (last one).,3,"I think deferring IO until the end (top level) and building up helper functions helps me write more readable, testable, and in a timely manner.",For the user-posts-comments query task (5-2) I should have thought about the whole problem and each subtask before I started on the first one. I could have written my solution in a way to reduce duplication and save time for the third subtask.,"I liked how the plugin could bring up similar code to what I needed, which I then could modify to suit my needs, which can save time of looking the API reference up on a browser. If I tried to look up anything really specific or try to refer to existing variables in my code, then it would slow me down a lot because it never really worked the way I wanted it to.",Yes
8/2/2020 18:45:56,a061d03ba2e23bf8f3861f78d7d62248,I thought they were good and quite thorough for testing the plugin. Perhaps there could have been less of an emphasis on file I/O.,3,"On a few occasions, the plugin very conveniently gave me the snippet of code I was looking for. This was generally when the method was ""on the tip of my tongue"". Even just having the snippets mined from StackOverflow visible in the IDE was a good memory refresher / source of ideas. The functionality for correcting the snippet and sending it back seems to work nicely. I basically treated the plugin in the same way I would treat Google or StackOverflow, and if it could not answer my query, I went to Google. The integration into PyCharm seems smooth.","It seems to only work if I want to generate an entire line of code, when sometimes I want to generate an expression to be inserted somewhere, to be assigned to a variable, or to match the indentation level, without having to tell the plugin this explicitly. I didn't feel like the plugin was aware of context. For working with both pandas and sklearn, the generated snippets made little sense and were not very relevant to what I requested. However, perhaps I am not familiar enough with those libraries to be specific about what I wanted.",It's really satisfying when it works; I could definitely see this being great in a later iteration. I enjoyed trying it out!,Yes
8/3/2020 15:11:02,638965bbb0d66a5b0eae27d1324bbf89,I think the tasks had an appropriate mixture of difficulties to test impact of the plug-in. ,4,"The plugin excels in letting you look up little syntax bits that you have forgotten, but where you have a good background understanding of the underlying principles/modules/frameworks.",It would be really useful if the documentation - that is displayed in the IDE when you hover over a function name - could also be seen in the same way in the plugin. Otherwise it can be difficult to decide which of the suggestions is the correct one when you are not familiar with a module. ,"It would be nice if the plug-in could check and if necessary add imports that are required for the generated code. I noticed that I can't submit plug-in code in a line that already contains some other text. To me it felt impractical to phrase the assignment of a function to a variable as an English sentence. I would much prefer to be able to write ""var = "" in the IDE and then ask the plug-in for some function.",Yes
8/4/2020 6:44:18,3290155d5f39c2cece41ce216eecac62,"It was great, helped me a lot and it was a nice opportunity to practice problem solving.",5,It is a faster way to search for small problems in syntax and to find the correct syntax for the new problems,I think the searching skills were the most important part of all,I think displaying some answers from stackoverflow would be helpful not just pieces of code,Yes

",3,It's easier to generate big chunks of code for let's say iterating over a text file for example than having to look it up then copy it or writing it yourself,Sometimes the results that show up are not really related to the search query                 ,"I found a bug when using the tool.

8/6/2020 17:20:55,42387deceb25d7486993e2a2d58e14ea,"They seemed to be chosen in a manner such that a person who is not in constant practice of a library would have to search for the API docs online or ask the plugin a question. The tasks were mostly straightforward, and fulfilling because they helped reinforce some basic python skills.",3,"The plugin did not help a lot, because I feel that I am better at finding answers on the internet. Otherwise, the plugin was actually quite useful to me towards the end when I got the hang of it and could formulate questions in the correct way to it (which I feel, qualifies is somewhat of a skill in itself - for this version of the plugin).","Debugging support, interactive response the way PyCharm provides for imported libraries. Making the plugin more interactive and more seamless would take it a long way.","Perhaps a TODO list filled by a user in the header, which auto-checks off as and when a task in the TODO list is completed could make for a more organized approach while developing.",Yes

I think a well commented example would help and i know it is not easy, that's my only suggestion.",N/A,Yes

8/12/2020 10:45:54,e78bbc00ea23e3688e035426717b63ac,"I think they were tougher than I anticipated, so I apologise if I took a while to complete some of them!",4,"I like that the plugin stops me having to go and search online for solutions, particularly when all I need is one quick line of code or to remember the command for something. Whilst working on the virtual machine I didn't want to procrastinate on the internet with facebook, youtube etc. However when I am doing tasks on my own computer it can be very easy to get distracted when searching for solutions online, so I feel like the plugin is something which would help improve my overall efficiency.","I think sometimes the plugin can be intimidating, I feel like it is hard to get a complicated solution using it without more context. Perhaps sometimes when providing solutions from stackoverflow, it could also provide a link to the solutions page? This may help the user with finding a more tailored solution for their program.","In regards to my previous comment, something which could also help find a more tailored solution would be if there could be some kind of chatbot functionality? What I mean by this is perhaps if you could identify the rough area in which the user needs assistance, a chatbot could help narrow it down further, helping to pinpoint an exact solution. Hopefully the way I have explained that makes sense, please feel free to contact me if you would like further clarity on this suggestion.",Yes

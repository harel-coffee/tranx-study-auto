# Hello World

# Task Description

Write a program in Python 3.6 that prints "Hello World!" on screen.

Please familiarize yourself with the IDE environment as well as the plugin (read [quick start](https://github.com/neulab/tranX-plugin#usage) first)

For the purpose of learning the IDE and the plugin, you should try asking the plugin how to print the string, selecting one of the desired candidates, modifying the auto-generated or retrieved code snippets accordingly, and eventually upload your edit for study purposes.

# Example Output

```
$ python3 main.py
Hello World!
```

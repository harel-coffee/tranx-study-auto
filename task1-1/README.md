# Task Description

After running `python3 main.py`, the program first randomly generate 100 lower-cased characters (a-z) and randomly generate 100 integers (1-20 inclusive).
Pair the randomly generated characters and numbers together to form a dictionary, where the key is characters and the value is the list of integers paired with the character.
Print out the dictionary content one key per line sorted by key (a-z), and also the list of numbers sorted in increasing order.

$ python3 main.py
a 3 5 6
b 1 1 2 4 5
c 19

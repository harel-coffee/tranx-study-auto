# Task Description

By running `python main.py`, draw a scatter plot of the data in `shampoo.csv` and save it to `shampoo.png` with a size of 600x400 pixels. The `Date` column is the x axis (note that some dates are missing from the data and in the plot the x axis should be complete with all missing dates), and the `Sales` column is the y axis. The graph should have the title "Shampoo Sales Trend". The font size of the title, legend, and axis labels should be 20pt, 14pt, and 12pt respectively. 
The legend should be put to the right of the figure (not within the figure itself).

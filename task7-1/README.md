# Task Description

By running `python3 main.py`, draw a scatter plot of the data in `shampoo.csv` and save it to `shampoo.png`.
The plot size should be with a size of 10 inches wide and 6 inches high. 
The `Date` column is the x axis (some dates are missing from the data and in the plot the x axis should be completed with all missing dates without sales data). 
The date string shown on the plot should be in format (YYYY-MM-DD).
The `Sales` column is the y axis. The graph should have the title "Shampoo Sales Trend". The font size of the title, axis labels, and x & y tick values should be 20pt, 16pt, and 12pt respectively.
The scatter color should be in `purple`.
